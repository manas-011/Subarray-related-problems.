Subarray and contribution related problem.

1. Finding the sum of all subarray of an array.

   sol : a , a + b , a + b + c 
         b , b + c 
         c 

2.  Finding the no of subarray having sum exact k 
3.  Finding the no of subarray having sum equal to 0 (replace k with 0) 
4.  Finding the no of subarray where sum of all eles of subarray is divisible by k (sum % k == 0)
5.  Finding the no of subarray where sum % k == rem (sum = sum of all eles of subarray) 

6.  In contribution technique basically you have to find the contribution of individual ele for all subarray (or for all possible subset)
7.  In general finding all possible subarrys problems or finding all possible pairs problem generally we use two-pointer technique 
    we stay at one position and try to find answer for all the subarray if we include that current ele in my subarray.

8.  Finding maximum or minimum element of subarray of size k. (use multiset or priority queue to solve this or u can use stack or queue to
    solve this as well).

9.  Maximize the window size or minimize the window size related problem.
